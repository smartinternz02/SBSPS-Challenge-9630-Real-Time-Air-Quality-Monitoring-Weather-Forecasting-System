Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring &amp; Weather Forecasting System


Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring & Weather Forecasting System This model consists of two models :- Air Quality Monitoring System and Weather Forecasting Model. Weather Forecasting Model is working on the dataset that consists of temperature trend spread across 100 years. Real Time Air Quality Monitoring system works on the dataset consisting od data of AQI for cities of INDIA from 2015 to 2020 Main Aim of the Projects is to understand and analyse the AQI and Temperature trend of India that will eventually help to understand and make more accurate predictions Our Team has divided the SBPS into two parts :- Weather Forecasting System and Real Time Air Quality System. Our team has successfully made the backend of the problem statemnt and it has been uploaded ob the git repo. Our team is currently working on the integration of our proposed solution to the front end in the form of User Interface.

We build the System and deployed it in Heroku cloud. Here is the link for our [System](https://aerocharmweb.herokuapp.com/).
